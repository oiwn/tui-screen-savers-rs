# 🦀 TARTS: Terminal Arts 🎨

> **BLAZINGLY FAST** terminal screensavers written in Rust!

`tarts` (shortcut from **T**erminal **Arts**) is a collection of **MEMORY SAFE** terminal-based screen savers that bring visual delight to your command line. Built with **ZERO-COST ABSTRACTIONS**, these screen savers run efficiently while providing stunning visual effects.

## ✨ Features

- 🌧️ **Matrix Rain**: Experience the famous "Matrix" digital rain effect right in your terminal
- 🧫 **Conway's Game of Life**: Watch the classic cellular automaton evolve before your eyes
- 🧩 **Maze Generation**: Get lost in procedurally generated mazes
- 🐦 **Boids**: Witness the emergent flocking behavior of these simulated birds
- 🧊 **3D Cube**: Renders a rotating 3D cube using terminal graphics with braille patterns for higher resolution.
- 🦀 **Crab**: Animated crabs walking across your screen, interacting with each other and the environment.
- - 🍩 **Rotating Donut**: A mesmerizing rotating donut rendered in the terminal

## 🚀 Installation

Install directly using cargo:

```bash
cargo install tarts
```

or you can use it like a library for your own TUI app!

## 🛠️ Usage

To use the screen savers, run the executable with the desired screen saver's name as an argument:

```bash
tarts matrix  # The classic digital rain effect
tarts life    # Conway's Game of Life
tarts maze    # Watch a maze generate itself
tarts boids   # Bird-like flocking simulation
tarts cube    # 3d rotating cube using braille patterns
tarts crab    # Ferris the crab with collisions
tarts donut  # Rotating donut
```

Press `q` or `Esc` to exit (or even Ctrl+C).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Not implemented yet. I think it should be toml file where you can set options for effects.

## 🧪 Development
